      Programmers need to use HTML for creating the basic structure of the website.
      They will be given 30 minutes to complete their html code after which they will be just allowed to add "div" class
      if required
      for their CSS.
    </p>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <img class="css-image" src="images-page2/css.png" alt="">

      The next one hour will be given for implementing css for the code.
      CSS must be implemented only in the given hour,no changes in the code will be allowed after this hour.
